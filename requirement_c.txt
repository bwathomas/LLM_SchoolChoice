# These are the general C dependencies and commands you might need to install them on a Debian-based system. Adjust as needed for your environment.

# For cURL
libcurl4-openssl-dev

# For Windows API (if you're on Windows, you might need Visual Studio with the C++ development tools)
# On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can skip this since Windows headers are not available.

# For general build tools
build-essential
python3-dev
